# Loot-Abacus

Simply put, this is a basic tip calculator. You are able to put your check amount, desired tip percentage, and when calculated, it will tell you the tip amount and the total with the tip added to the total. At the bottom, if you want to split the tip between people, just put the number of people dividing the tip, and it will give each person's tip total they should contribute.

I've wanted to make this application for a while now. Not because there is a shortage of them...as there surely are not. I did this to prove to myself that I could. A simple idea, into reality. And I have Fuse to thank for that.

Fuse is the mobile development platform I used for this project. It allowed me to code in JavaScript (as most mobile app. dev. platforms only work in JAVA). The main file will be MainView.xm, and can be viewed using Sublime Text, or nearly any other coding software. Some alterations had to be made with the code, as Fuse is still in it's infancy, but for what it is now and what it is currently capable of, I will be using Fuse from here on out.
